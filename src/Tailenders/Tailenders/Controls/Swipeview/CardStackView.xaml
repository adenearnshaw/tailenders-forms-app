            HACK: The TouchObserber is a terrible hack, so let me explain the problem
            On Android, Child elements obserb touch events and don't pass them to the sender.
            So when attaching the PanGestureRecognizer to the parent view, it won't fire, when dragging the child.
            To fix this temporary, I added this transparent view on top of all others and attach the PanGestureRecognizer to it.
            A custom view renderer with an "IgnoreTouch" property might be a smarter solution...
