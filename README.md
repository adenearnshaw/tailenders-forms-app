# Tailenders-Forms-App - MidWicket

A Tinder-style dating app with a cricket theme inspired by the BBC Tailenders podcast.

The app uses the Xamarin Forms UI framework and has been primarily optimised for iOS. The plan was to initially launch this on iOS, with Android coming soon after. As is fairly standard, the app follows the MVVM pattern using the [MVVM Light](http://www.mvvmlight.net/) toolkit to assist.

The app uses Azure Active Directory B2C to authenticate users, taking advantage of the integration with Facebook SSO.

With a planned launch at the Tailender's live show, there was a tight window to complete a working MVP. Unfortunately, Apple weren't completely happy with the blocking mechanism implemented, so this delayed the Store submission.

After discussion with the BBC Producers, it was decided not to launch the app, but rather, get Jimmy Anderson to shred a paper analogue of the app on stage. As such, the development of the app was shelved, but was immortalised by England's greatest ever bowler :)
